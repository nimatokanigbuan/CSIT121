    <p> This week was my first time exploring HTML. Although it's pretty tedious it can be entertaing as well. If I were to give advice to someone just starting, I would recommend practicing every time they learn about a new element. By doing this, I found that some things started to feel a habit, and it's only been a week!</p>
        <h3>Things I've Learned</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>HTML is a coding language that defines the structure and meaning of content on a web page</li>
            <li>Web Standards exist to ensure websites work on all devices and enhance the online experience for everyone</li>
        </ol>
    <p>There were some great resources included in the modules so far, here are my favs:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_upload">Markup Validator</a></li>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>This weekâ€™s lab was calm, I was able to learn how interactivity is added to webpages using JavaScript. I also saw some cool CSS animations that would make a website more engaging. Integrating code into my site allowed me to experiment by modifying it, changing elements, and adapting it to match what I already had. It also improved my problem-solving skills which will help create my own code from scratch next time.</p>

            <h3>File Type Information</h3>

            <h3>Why I Chose This Image</h3>
            <p>I chose this image because after finding the very excited face image I started thinking about things that make me feel that way. Of course I ended up with a plate of food.</p>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>This weekâ€™s lab was calm, I was able to learn how interactivity is added to webpages using JavaScript. I also saw some cool CSS animations that would make a website more engaging. Integrating code into my site allowed me to experiment by modifying it, changing elements, and adapting it to match what I already had. It also improved my problem-solving skills which will help create my own code from scratch next time.</p>

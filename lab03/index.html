    <p> This week was my first time exploring HTML. Although it's pretty tedious it can be entertaing as well. If I were to give advice to someone just starting, I would recommend practicing every time they learn about a new element. By doing this, I found that some things started to feel a habit, and it's only been a week!</p>
        <h3>Things I've Learned</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>HTML is a coding language that defines the structure and meaning of content on a web page.</li>
            <li>Web Standards exist to ensure websites work on all devices and enhance the online experience for everyone.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Things I've Learned Part 2</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>External stylesheets allow you to change the appearance of multiple HTML pages by linking them to a single CSS file.</li>
                    <li>CSS can be used to control text styling, such as font types, colors, and layout, improving the user experience and design.</li>
                </ol>
    <p>There were some great resources included in the modules so far, here are my favs:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_upload">Markup Validator</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics">HTML Basics</a></li>

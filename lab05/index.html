                <h3>Week 1</h3>
                <p>This week was my first time exploring HTML. Although it's pretty tedious it can be entertaining as well. If I were to give advice to someone just starting, I would recommend practicing every time they learn about a new element. By doing this, I found that some things started to feel like a habit and it's only been a week!</p>
                <p style="background-color: white;">These are some key takeaways from this week's module:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>HTML is a coding language that defines the structure and meaning of content on a web page.</li>
                    <li>Web Standards exist to ensure websites work on all devices and enhance the online experience for everyone.</li>
                </ol>
            </article>

                <h3>Week 2</h3>
                <p>Learning to use external stylesheets has been a fun part of my web design experience. By linking multiple HTML pages to a single CSS file, I was able to make my site consistent. I also saved time and effort when making design changes. Practicing with fonts, colors, and text sizes not only made the website more visually appealing but also more professional looking.</p>
                <p style="background-color: white;">There were some great resources included in the modules so far, here are my favs:</p>
                     <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_upload">Markup Validator</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics">HTML Basics</a></li>

                <h3>This Weeks Reflection</h3>
                <p>Some key design practices I've learned include ensuring a layout that adjusts for different screen sizes, optimizing readability, and maintaining consistency in design elements. Following these principles makes the website more accessible and user-friendly.</p>
                <p style="background-color: white;">Some intresting facts I learned this week:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>55% to 60% of global website traffic comes from mobile devices</li>
                            <li>Websites that follow accessibility standards not only support people with disabilities but also improve SEO, as search engines can better understand your content.</li>
